            Initially, I wanted to make a page and have the user access it to learn more about the characters; however, it felt too complicated, so instead, I changed it to users filtering characters based on their gender, status, and name.
           </p>
           <p>
            To ensure that I have gone above and beyond, I have dynamically created a button through JS. Although I had tried to ensure that the last page did not have a button, it was giving more issues, so the buttons still exist even if it is the last page. When a user types an invalid search, I ensure no buttons.
           </p>
           <p>I had chosen this API as this is my favorite show, and I wanted to pay homage to it. Another thing I have added is a scrollable background image to make the website look more professional.</p>
           <p>On top of that, I have ensured that users can type names in any way they want. However, the API only takes names starting with an uppercase letter; the rest are lowercase. To ensure that the results are still valid, I parsed usersâ€™ searches to match the way the API would like.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Based on the feedback, I decided to add more features to make the website more  accessible and easier to read</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scrollable Background images:
                    <p>I added this feature to make it look more interractive</p>
                </li>
                <li>Responsiveness
                    <p>As soon as the website screen size becomes narrow enough, I had changed the search bar option into column direction to make it look better.</p>
                </li>
                <li>User Input<p>
                    Since the API requires names in a certain order to make the website easier for them. I had parse the data to lowercase and ensured that evvery word's first letter is capitalised.
                </p></li>
                <li>Next Button <p>
                    Originally, I wanted to add a previous button but I had time limitations. This buttons ensures that the users can go through all the values. 
                </p></li>
